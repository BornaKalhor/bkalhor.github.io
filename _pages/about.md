This is Borna, a computer engineering graduate from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

My interest areas are in the fields of usable privacy and security, network security, IoT security, and information retrieval. I have taken specialized courses and worked on projects related to these topics during my undergraduate studies.

Through coursework and projects, I have developed proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, C, and Assembly. I have experience building networking tools, access control systems, search engines, data mining applications, and recommender systems.

Outside of my technical skills, I enjoy staying active by going to the gym and hiking. I find these sports help me relax and recharge after long hours of study. Photography is another hobby of mine, and I like taking landscape photos in particular. I'm also an avid coffee drinker â˜•
